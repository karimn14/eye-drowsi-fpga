# CNN eye-state accelerator on Basys 3

Group 3 KCCI FPGA project: integer CNN inference and observation-count
closure warning on the Basys 3 (Artix-7 xc7a35tcpg236-1).

**Start with [setup and demo](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) and
[current status/limitations](docs/STATUS_AND_ISSUES.md).**

## System

```text
Webcam -> Laptop: MediaPipe -> eye/brow crop -> grayscale 24x24 -> contrast
       -> UART image upload -> FPGA: CNN -> OPEN/CLOSED -> warning FSM
       -> UART result -> Windows GUI/OpenCV preview, board LEDs/display/buzzer
```

The FPGA also retains 16 ROM test slots and board sequence modes. Camera
localization/preprocessing runs on the laptop; there is no direct camera
sensor interface on the FPGA. The model is
`24x24 u8 -> Conv3x3x4 -> ReLU(>>10, sat 127) -> MaxPool2 -> Conv3x3x8 ->
ReLU(>>6, sat 127) -> MaxPool2 -> FC 128->2 -> argmax`.

## Results and evidence

| Measurement | Result | Configuration / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| CNN latency | 712 cycles = **4.75 us at 150 MHz** (`rtl/cnn150`, Handy 14704ca, 5 Nov; 100 MHz core: 702 cycles = 7.02 us) | UART integer us field truncates to 4 |
| FPGA resources | 2,376 LUT, 2,230 FF, 7.5 BRAM, 14 DSP | drowsiness_top + real CNN + UART/upload + buzzer; 9dac154, Vivado 2025.2, build uart_hw_20261104_131740 |
| Routed timing | Setup +0.948 ns, hold +0.067 ns | [Raw reports and input hashes](docs/reports/current_build_20261104/README.md); all 29 recorded build-input hashes match reviewed main e3ac7ea |
| RTL/golden | 16/16 exported logit pairs identical; 14/16 labels correct | Recorded regressions; slots 0/1 are known model misses |
| Host/GUI | 30 host tests, Release GUI build and mock bridge smoke pass | [Selected evidence](docs/reports/current_build_20261104/README.md); operator reports physical integrated GUI passed |
| CPU baseline | CPU median 152.8 us; FPGA 79.96 us; **1.911x** | [Exact integer NumPy baseline](integration/docs/INFERENCE_BENCHMARK.md), Ryzen 9 5900HS, Balanced; not an optimized INT8-runtime comparison |
| Exported model accuracy | train 97.23%, valid 94.44%, test 98.15% (108 images) | Prior recomputation from committed export/crops; small single-subject evaluation with possible frame leakage |

These are CNN compute times, not webcam/serial/display latency. Different
historical builds have different resource/timing results; use the
[evidence index](docs/reports/README.md). Dataset accuracy does not establish
performance on unseen people. Live target 10 Hz is not guaranteed throughput;
Frame ID exhaustion and manual gap recovery remain documented limitations.

## Run

Follow [one host setup and board/GUI checklist](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).
The camera environment is Python 3.12 `.venv-camera`; Windows GUI builds
with .NET 8. Full integrated bitstream build:

```powershell
vivado -mode batch -source integration/scripts/build_uart.tcl
```

This uses `integration/rtl/drowsiness_top.v`. The root
`vivado/create_project.tcl` and `rtl/basys3_wrapper.v` form a separate
standalone CNN demo; its controls/bitstream are not the integrated GUI flow.

## Verification and contributions

With Bash, Icarus Verilog/vvp and Python/NumPy, run `bash run_sim.sh` and
`bash integration/sim/run.sh`. Host tests and GUI smoke commands are in
[the setup guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md). Software and hardware evidence
are labelled separately. Small vectors/model exports/reports are deliberate
artifacts; build caches and personal inputs are excluded. See
[repository policy](docs/REPOSITORY_POLICY.md).
